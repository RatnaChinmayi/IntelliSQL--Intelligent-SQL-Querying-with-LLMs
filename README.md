# 📌 IntelliSQL: Intelligent SQL Querying with LLMs

## 🔹 Project Overview

**IntelliSQL** is an AI-powered SQL assistant that enables users to interact with databases using natural language. The system leverages Google’s Gemini Pro Large Language Model (LLM) to convert natural language queries into optimized SQL statements and retrieve results from a SQLite database.

This project simplifies database querying for both beginners and experienced users by providing intelligent query assistance and seamless data exploration capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Intelligent Query Assistance
- Converts natural language into SQL queries
- Suggests correct SQL syntax
- Generates optimized SQL statements
- Assists beginners in understanding query logic

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration & Insights
- Accepts plain English questions
- Automatically translates to SQL
- Retrieves relevant database results
- Helps uncover patterns and insights from data

## 🏗️ Project Workflow

1. User enters a natural language query in the Streamlit UI.
2. The input is sent to the backend.
3. The Google API key is used to authenticate the request.
4. The input is forwarded to the Gemini Pro pre-trained model.
5. The model converts the natural language query into SQL.
6. The SQL query is executed on the SQLite database.
7. Results are displayed on the frontend interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** – For building the web interface
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro)** – For Natural Language to SQL conversion
- **SQLite3** – Lightweight database for demonstration
- **python-dotenv** – For secure API key management (optional)

## 📋 Requirements

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following libraries:
streamlit
google-generativeai
sqlite3
> Note: sqlite3 comes built-in with Python, so no separate installation is required.

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv myenv
### Activate the environment:
myenv\Scripts\activate
### Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## 🔑 Google API Key Setup

1. Generate a Google Gemini API key.
2. Create a `.env` file in your project folder.
3. Add your API key:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup (SQLite3)

### Create Database and Table
- Establish connection using sqlite3.
- Create required tables.
- Insert sample records.
- Commit changes.
- Close the connection.
The database is used for demonstration purposes and executes SQL queries generated by the Gemini model.

---

## 🤖 Model Integration
- Load Gemini Pro pre-trained model.
- Write a prompt to guide SQL generation.
- Implement function to:
  - Convert Natural Language to SQL.
  - Execute SQL query on SQLite database.
  - Display results in Streamlit UI.

---

## 🌐 Model Deployment
The application is deployed using **Streamlit**, which allows:
- Interactive UI
- Real-time model interaction
- Seamless user experience

### Run the application using:
streamlit run app.py

---

## 🎯 Applications
- SQL learning assistant
- Data analysis support tool
- Intelligent database querying system
- Educational project for AI + Databases integration
